# Documentation Assignment

This assigment helps you improve your documentation skills.

## Task 1: Code Comments (15 points)

Task 1 involves commenting and cleaning up some poorly written code.
look at task_1.py and test_task_1.py and try to understand what the 
`func` function and `Thingy` class do. Then:

1. Clean up the code by giving variables descriptive names
2. Add a few comments to make the code more clear
3. Add numpy style docstrings to `func` and `Thingy`. Be sure to include necessary sections and an example. Don't worry about the dunders.
4. Rename the test classes and cases in test_task_1.py to be more descriptive. Add brief docstring descriptions.


## Task 3: Readme (10 points)

In this last assignment, you will create a fictional readme. Create a readme
for a python package you wish existed (and potentially could with enough 
work, so nothing magical). You can use 
[this](https://github.com/banesullivan/README) as a template, but you can also
do your own thing. Make sure after looking at your readme for less than 1 minute
a user knows what it does and what a basic code example looks like.

Note: Writing high-level documentation before coding is known, among other names,
as [Documentation Driven Development](https://gist.github.com/zsup/9434452) and it
is a very good idea for designing nice APIs.
